# JOSEPHSON Junction actions as a non linear inductor. We have simulated this nature in COMSOL and its interaction with 2D cavity.

# This contains theoretic results important to get insight in the working of a qubit inside microwave cavity. We have made an analogy with coupled spring-mass system to understand the coupling of the qubit with the resonant cavity.
